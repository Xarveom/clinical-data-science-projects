## 🧪 Objective

Analyze global COVID-19 cases and deaths using real-world data from Our World in Data.

---

## 📦 Load Required Packages

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
```

---

## 📂 Load the Data

```{r}
covid <- read_csv("D:/R Programming/data/owid-covid-data.csv")
```
This dataset has over 429,000 rows and 67 columns, including cases, deaths, dates, locations, and more.

---

## 🔍 Select and Clean Relevant Columns

```{r}
covid_clean <- covid %>%
  select(location, continent, date, total_cases, total_deaths) %>%
  filter(!is.na(continent), !is.na(total_cases))
```

---

## 📅 Find the Most Recent Date

```{r}
latest_date <- max(covid_clean$date)
latest_date
```

---

## 📊 Summarise Cases and Deaths by Continent (Latest Date)

```{r}
covid_latest <- covid_clean %>%
  filter(date == latest_date) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    total_cases = sum(total_cases, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_deaths = sum(total_deaths, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
covid_latest
```

---

## 🔁 Reshape Data to Long Format (Tidy)

```{r}
covid_tidy <- covid_latest %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(total_cases, total_deaths),
               names_to = "metric",
               values_to = "count")
covid_tidy
```

## ✏️ Questions Answered

### 1. Which continent had the most total cases?

Asia

### 2. What’s the total number of deaths globally?

```{r}
sum(covid_latest$total_deaths, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### 3. Why reshape to long format?

Long format is preferred for plotting grouped metrics and works better with `ggplot2`, `facet_wrap`, and tidyverse tools.
